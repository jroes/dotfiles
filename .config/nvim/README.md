# Adrien's neovim config

This is based on [dam9000/kickstart](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).

## Todo

* [ ] Split out Mason into it's own installer
* [ ] Move old plugins to an `old/` folder
* [ ] Go through all plugins and see what I can remove

<!--* Update the copilot config so that <tab> is not remapped for .md files-->
<!--    * ...and possibly not for any files which copilot skips?-->
