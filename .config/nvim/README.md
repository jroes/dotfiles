# Adrien's neovim config

This is based on [dam9000/kickstart](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).

## Todo

* Go through my old plugins
    * `phaazon/hop.nvim`
    * `github/copilot.vim`
    * `williamboman/mason.nvim`
    * `williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim`
    * maybe later
        * `tpope/vim-surround`
        * `psf/black`

* Split out Mason into it's own installer

* Copy over my old telescope config

* Go through my old neovim config and add things that I liked
    * Keybindings
        * `<leader>p` - nice paste thing
        * `<leader>w` - nice write things
* Do I really want this which-key thing?

* Test that Python coding is working nicely

* install LuaRocks? `sudo apt install liblua5.1-0-dev`
    * Then install `luaformatter`?

## Later

* Install Rust plugins
    * `simrat39/rust-tools.nvim`
    * `rust-lang/rust.vim`
* Typescript stuff?
    * `leafgarland/typescript-vim`
    * `peitalin/vim-jsx-typescript`
* TOML stuff?
    * `cespare/vim-toml`
* LUA stuff?
    * `L3MON4D3/LuaSnip`
